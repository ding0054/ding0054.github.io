# ding0054.github.io  - Final Web Portfolio

## a brief description on how you created your web portfolio
    Through this semester's study, I use grid framework to write the page layout. 
    In this assignment, I used a lot of my new knowledge. For example, animation, how to create a button, reference bootsDrop. 
    I also consolidated what I had learned before, such as how to establish links between pages.
## challenges I faced during development
    During the development process, the most annoying thing for me is the layout of divs and the gap between items. 
    At first I was trying and trying, but it was very inefficient. Then I used Web Inspect to check for module problems. 
    It was very effective, and I was able to pinpoint exactly     what was going wrong.
## learned by creating web portfolio
   What I learned the most in this assignment was how to create animations. You can learn much more by trial and error.
