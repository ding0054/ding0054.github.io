                    My name is Xiaoyu Ding. I am came from China and 2021 is 8<sup>th</sup> year that I have been living
                    in Canada.
                    As my previous life in China, I already had a bachelor's degree in art design.
                    However, I wanted to challenge myself in a new field when I decided studing in<em>Algonquin College</em>
                    so I studied computer programmer at <em>Algonquin College</em> and got my diploma. 
                    During the two years of study experience,
                    I felt that writing code was not very interesting.
                    According to my experience, I decided to study the current course.
                    I'm very enjoying my studies so far and I think I've finally found the right field for me.
                    In this semster I started learning <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
                    and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> I belive thoese things gona be very cool for me.
